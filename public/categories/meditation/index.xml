      <description>&lt;p&gt;How many 21st Century discipleship plans for new Christians include an in-depth study of the Torah? My guess: not many. But it seems that the Apostle Paul had a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Freed from People to Serve People</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them. â€”Apostle Paul, 1 Corinthians 9:19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can never really serve people until we&amp;rsquo;re free of people. We can never fully and freely work for the good of others until we don&amp;rsquo;t need anything from them.&lt;/p&gt;

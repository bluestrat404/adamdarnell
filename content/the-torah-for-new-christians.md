How many 21st Century discipleship plans for new Christians include an in-depth study of the Torah? My guess: few to none. But it seems that the Apostle Paul had a different approach.

The Torah, of course, is the Hebrew name for the first five books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Also called the Pentateuch, if you want to sound impressive about it.

In 1 Corinthians 10:6-10, Paul assumes the Corinthians' knowledge of five different events recorded in the Torah. The verses read:

> Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did. Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play." We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents, nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.

To trace the five references:

1. "Desire evil" plays on a phrase in Numbers 11, where the Israelites were dissatisfied with the manna from heaven and complained against God.
2. "The people sat down..." is a quote from Exodus 32, when the Israelites made a golden calf to worship it.
3. "Twenty-three thousand fell in a single day" in Numbers 25.
4. The incident with the serpents is recorded in Numbers 21.
5. And the destruction for grumbling, depending on whom you ask, refers either to Korah's rebellion in Numbers 16, or to the death of the first generation of Israelites in the wilderness, prophesied in Numbers 14.

Again, in the space of five verses, Paul assumes a pretty deep working knowledge of the Torah on the part of the Corinthian Christians. And the church in Corinth would've been a predominately Gentile church, meaning most of them didn't grow up learning the Hebrew Bible.

**So, one of the very first things Paul must have taught young Christians was nothing less than *the entirety of the Torah*.**

And it's not just 1 Corinthians 10:6-10 that has deep roots in the Old Testament; the same is true for every chapter of every book of the New Testament.

The Torah was, for Paul, foundational to Christian discipleship. What do we lose if it's not also that for Christians today?

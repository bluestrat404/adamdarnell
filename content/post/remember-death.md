> It’s easy to think about your life as a ladder you’re climbing rung by rung. Finish school. Pay off loans. Find a spouse and have some kids. Buy a home. Then buy a better one. Get tenure. Make partner. You could take it from here. You know what I mean.
> 
> When life feels like this to you, tomorrow is everything. It’s full of promise and possibility. Tomorrow is when you arrive.
> 
> Death puts tomorrow in another perspective entirely. Whatever else tomorrow may bring, it will certainly bring death. From that view, tomorrow is no friend. Tomorrow is my great enemy.

I'm super excited for my friend Matt McCullough's new book, *Remember Death: The Surprising Path to Living Hope*. Matt is the real deal. He and I attended Grace Community Church in Nashville together, and he's like an older brother to me to this day.

As the founding pastor of Trinity Church in Nashville, TN, Matt is faithful and genuine, gentle and fearless, wise and kind.

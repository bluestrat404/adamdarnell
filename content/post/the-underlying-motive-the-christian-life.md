The glory of God and the good of others is the underlying motive of the faithful Christian life.

Whatever Christians do, from the biggest things in life all the way down to the little decisions each day, we're to ask two questions:

1. Is this helpful for building up my neighbor? And,
2. Is this to the glory of God?

This comes from the text I'll be preaching this Sunday: 1 Corinthians 10:23-11:1. Here are three of the key verses:

> "All things are lawful," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful," but not all things build up. Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor . . . So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. —1 Corinthians 10:23-24, 31; ESV

Let's look at those in the order they appear.

## What Builds Up?

Christians don't ask, "What may I do? What's allowed?" and then go do that. We are not law-bound people. We've been set free by grace not to be concerned for ourselves. We've been saved by faith in the cross of Christ.

We are secure in Christ, which enables us to ask, "What will be helpful for my neighbor? What will build up my neighbor?"

Our behavior is not controlled by our need for self-expression or self-protection. We've been set free in Christ from those things.

Christian behavior—and words, by the way, but that's another verse—truly Christian behavior is motivated by what is helpful and good for others, both their body and their soul.

How would your day look different if your underlying motive in your every action was the helpful building up of your neighbor, body and soul?

> Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.

## What Glorifies God?

The second question is, "What glorifies God?"

> Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.

Again, Christians don't ask, "What can I do? What's good for me? What do I feel like doing?" Those who follow Christ are concerned not for the glory of self or any other thing, but for the glory of God.

The glory of God as an underlying motive gives profound meaning to every action, even the most trivial.

If the glory of God is your main concern in your work—you work as unto the Lord, doing excellent work as worship toward your excellent Creator—then no matter what your work is, it has eternal meaning.

## Two Questions?

At the bottom, the two questions are one. To seek the good of others, as God has sought your good in sending His only Son, is to glorify God. To glorify God is to seek the good of others.

Someone once asked Jesus,

> "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?" And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets." —Matthew 22:36-40, ESV

We'll go deeper into this on Sunday. You can prepare your heart by reflecting on the question, "What's my motivation?"

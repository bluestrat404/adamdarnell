You want the drug addict in your church, not the hurting former lay elder who's trying to control things on the way in.

What I mean is, the hurting former lay elder, who was burned in his last church, is, for very rational and well-intentioned reasons, trying to get as many meetings with the pastor as possible so that he can be assured he won't be hurt in this church. A warning to pastors: do not offer him that assurance!

Of course, a hurting former lay elder should always be welcome in any church, so long as he is not trying to control things on the way in.

The difference here is that the drug addict knows he's out of control and needs help, or otherwise he wouldn't be looking to join a church.

The person trying to control things on the way in is still trying to hedge his bets, to control his life, to mitigate his pain. He hasn't fully cast himself on the Lord and the Lord's sovereignty and mercy.

It is not loving to encourage a brother on that path by stepping in for that extra meeting. The person he needs to lean on is not you, the pastor of the church he may want to join, but Christ, the great Shepherd of all the Church.

The role of a pastor is: dependent on Christ, to point others to depend on Christ.

One assumes that the drug addict coming to church is really depending on Jesus, whereas anyone trying to control things on the way in is not.

That's why I say you want the drug addict in your church, not the hurting former lay elder who's trying to control things on the way in.

Don't give that guy extra meetings before he joins. Don't try to sell him on your church. That's probably favoritism anyway, and that's sin.

> Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. â€“Acts 20:28-31, ESV
